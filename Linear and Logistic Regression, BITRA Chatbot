Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a supervised learning technique used in both machine learning and statistics.
It is primarily applied to predict continuous numerical values.
The algorithm establishes a relationship between independent variables (inputs) and a dependent variable (output).
It assumes that the relationship between inputs and output is linear.
The model is expressed using a linear equation, where the output is calculated as a weighted sum of inputs along with a bias term.
The objective of Linear Regression is to determine the best-fitting straight line that represents the data.
During training, the model learns the optimal values for weights and bias.
The learning process aims to minimize the difference between predicted and actual values.
The most commonly used loss function is Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Linear Regression assumes that errors are independent and have constant variance (homoscedasticity).
It also assumes that residuals follow a normal distribution.
This algorithm is simple, fast, and easy to interpret.
It is widely used in fields such as economics, finance, healthcare, and engineering.
Typical applications include house price prediction, salary estimation, sales forecasting, and trend analysis.
However, Linear Regression is sensitive to outliers and performs poorly when the data is non-linear.

Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks.
It is most commonly applied to binary classification problems.
Despite its name, Logistic Regression is not used for predicting continuous values.
Instead, it estimates the probability that an input belongs to a specific class.
The algorithm begins by calculating a linear combination of input features.
This value is then passed through a sigmoid (logistic) function.
The sigmoid function converts the output into a value between 0 and 1.
A decision threshold, usually 0.5, is used to assign class labels.
The model is trained using the log loss (binary cross-entropy) function.
This loss function measures how close the predicted probabilities are to the actual class labels.
Logistic Regression does not assume a linear relationship between input features and output labels.
However, it assumes a linear relationship between features and the log-odds of the outcome.
The algorithm is simple, efficient, and interpretable.
It is widely used in applications such as spam detection, medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and credit scoring.
Logistic Regression can also be extended to handle multiclass problems using One-vs-Rest or Softmax techniques.


                  BITRA Chatbot

*BITRA is an AI-based chatbot developed for Bannari Amman Institute of Technology to support visitors on the institute’s website. Its primary function is to respond to frequently asked questions related to 
admissions, academic programs, fee structure, hostel facilities, and contact information.

*The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret user queries written in simple English. It operates as a retrieval-based system, where responses are selected from a predefined knowledge base rather 
than being generated dynamically.

*BITRA performs intent recognition to understand the user’s purpose, such as inquiries about admissions, courses, or departments. The knowledge base stores structured information about the institution, 
including departments, programs, and campus facilities.

*The chatbot follows a structured workflow: user input → NLP processing → intent classification → response retrieval → final reply. This approach enables quick and accurate responses while maintaining consistency.

*By providing instant answers, BITRA improves website navigation and reduces the need for users to manually search for information. It offers 24/7 assistance, helping to minimize the workload of the
administrative support staff.

*The chatbot plays a significant role in assisting prospective students by offering immediate admission-related guidance. To ensure reliability, it uses rule-based response templates.

*BITRA features a user-friendly chat interface integrated into the BIT website. However, it does not utilize advanced generative AI models like ChatGPT and may struggle with complex or unforeseen queries.

*Overall, BITRA enhances communication on the BIT website by delivering fast, dependable, and automated responses.
